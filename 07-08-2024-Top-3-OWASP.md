# Top 3 OWASP

The OWASP Foundation is a non profit foundation that promotes application security. It routinely publishes the OWASP Top Ten annually.

This article explores three prevalent web security threats frequently appearing in OWASP Top Ten: injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

## Injection Attacks

Injection attacks involve injecting malicious data into an application, often through user input fields, to exploit vulnerabilities.

### Example : SQL Injection
SQL injection occurs when an attacker manipulates an application's SQL queries.

#### Injection Prevention Methods
1. Input Sanitization: Remove special characters (e.g. single quotes) from user input.
2. Bind Parameters: Prevent by using bind parameters, databases cache execution plans if the SQL queries are exactly the same. Bind parameters are just place holders and the execution plans are reused. If there are changes to the execution plans i.e. the bind parameters are not just replacing the values and cannot change the execution plan hence preventing SQL injection.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to execute malicious scripts in a user's browser.

### Types of XSS Attacks

#### Example : Stored XSS
- Example: The input form is not sanitized and the saved message is displayed as html in the website. We can then enter in ``<script>malicious code here</script>`` which will then be stored in the database and ran when the user opens the website and loads the comments with the script in it

#### Example : Reflected XSS
- Example: The website takes in a search query which is displayed as html in the website. We can then enter in `q?searchquery="<script>malicious code here</script>"` which will then be ran in the browser when user clicks on the above link with that search query in it

### XSS Prevention Methods
1. Sanitize Input Fields: Filter out harmful characters and scripts from inputs.
2. Sanitize Stored HTML: Ensure stored data does not contain executable scripts.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CSRF exploits an authenticated user's session to perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.

### Example : CSRF
1. The attacker tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request, typically via a hidden form or link.
2. Example: In a malicious blog with a form to post comments we have hidden along with the post request, a separate post request to a bank server with request details to transfer money to our account. Since the victim is already logged in a session on a separate tab, when he posts on our blog, that post request is validated and goes through in the bank

### CSRF Prevention Methods
1. CSRF Tokens:
   - Generate a unique CSRF token for each legitimate form request.
   - Validate the token on the server side to ensure it matches the submitted request.
