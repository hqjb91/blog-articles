1. Injection Attacks
	1. SQL Injection
		1. Prevent by sanitizing the input fields to remove special characters such as single quotes
		2. Prevent by using bind parameters, databases cache execution plans if the SQL queries are exactly the same. Bind parameters are just place holders and the execution plans are reused. If there are changes to the execution plans i.e. the bind parameters are not just replacing the values and cannot change the execution plan hence preventing SQL injection
2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
	1. Client sided attack
	2. Stored XSS
		1. e.g. the input form is not sanitized and the saved message is displayed as html in the website. We can then enter in ``<script>malicious code here</script>`` which will then be stored in the database and ran when the user opens the website and loads the comments with the script in it
	3. Reflected XSS
		1. e.g. the website takes in a search query which is displayed as html in the website. We can then enter in `q?searchquery="<script>malicious code here</script>"` which will then be ran in the browser when user clicks on the above link with that search query in it
	4. Prevent by sanitizing the input fields and stored html
3. CSRF
	1. Client sided attack
	2. e.g. In a malicious blog with a form to post comments we have hidden along with the post request, a separate post request to a bank server with request details to transfer money to our account. Since the victim is already logged in a session on a separate tab, when he posts on our blog, that post request is validated and goes through in the bank
	3. Prevent by using a CSRF token that will change every time the legitimate form is requested and verify that the requests has the same token
